      1: `When Refuge Kitty-Kat reached out about their website struggles, I was eager to help. The local rescue was doing amazing work but their website wasn't doing them justice. I rebuilt their site from the ground up, focusing on what matters most: making it dead simple for people to donate, volunteer, and (most importantly) find their new cat.`,
      2: `The results have been good - more donations flowing in, volunteer applications up, and adoption rates climbing. Plus, the site's been climbing search rankings, which means more eyeballs on adoption postings (and more forever homes in the making).`,
      3: `It's pretty cool seeing your code make a real difference. Knowing this project is helping more animals find their way to new homes - that's what it's all about.`,

      1: `As an avid camper frustrated with jumping between countless websites to plan trips, I built CampVI to solve a simple problem: finding the perfect campsite shouldn't be a hassle. The site brings together every type of camping spot on Vancouver Island - from provincial parks to hidden off-grid gems - all in one clean, modern interface.`,
      2: `What started as a personal project has grown into a genuine resource for the island's outdoor community. With an interactive map, intuitive search features, and detailed site info, CampVI helps adventurers spend less time planning and more time exploring.`,
      3: `It's been nice getting messages from users who've discovered their new favourite camping spots through the site!`,

      2: `Though still new (built November 2024), TabZen is helping users focus on what matters - the music without the clutter. A simple fix for an annoying problem!`,
