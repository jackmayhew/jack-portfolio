# Jacks Portfolio

Just a super simple website—easy to use and minimalist. Really enjoyed building with Nuxt, it'll definitely be my go-to for future projects.

I’m still on the fence about Tailwind; there's some pros and cons for sure. I think I'll switch back to SCSS for now.

Might add a guestbook feature down the road—stay tuned!

Built with Nuxt3, GSAP, and Tailwind.
