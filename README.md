# Jacks Portfolio

Just a super simple websiteâ€”easy to use and minimalist. Really enjoyed building with Nuxt, it'll definitely be my go-to for future projects.

Still on the fence about Tailwind.. Pros and cons for sure. I think I'll switch back to SCSS for now.

Might add a guestbook down the road.

Built with Nuxt3, GSAP, and Tailwind.
