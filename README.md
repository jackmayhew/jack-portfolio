# Jack's Portfolio

My portfolio website built with Nuxt3. Kept it simple and clean. First time building with Nuxt, really enjoyed it.

Still unsure about Tailwind. Has its pros and cons. Might switch back to SCSS for now.

Thinking about adding a guestbook down the road.

**Built with:** Nuxt3, GSAP, Tailwind
