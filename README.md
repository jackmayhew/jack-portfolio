Just a super simple website—easy to use and minimalist. I really enjoyed building it with Nuxt and will definitely be using it for future projects.

I’m still on the fence about Tailwind; there are pros and cons for sure. I think I'll switch back to SCSS for my next projects.

Might add a guestbook feature down the road—stay tuned!

Feel free to explore!
